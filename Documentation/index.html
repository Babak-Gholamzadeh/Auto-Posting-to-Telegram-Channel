            <br>
            <p>You have two options to install the plagin:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Installing directly in WordPress Dashboard</li>
              <li>Using FTP access</li>

                <img src="assets/img/BotFather.jpg" alt="BotFather">

                <ol>

                  <li>then it will ask you to enter a username for your bot, and the username must end in 'bot' in anyway (and certainly the username must be something unique).</li>
                  <img src="assets/img/IDBotFather.jpg" alt="">
                  <li>After you enter a unique username for your bot, a message will be shown that give you a token.</li>

              <h3>Changing the Styles and Options of the Items</h3>
              <div class="subContent">
                <p>After adding some items you might need to change the styles of them (just a few styles that be offered by Telegram).</p>
                <p>First of all, in order to tweak them, you must hover your cursor over the added items.</p>
                <p>The first option is for adding a break line or a few empty lines after an item. For doing that just click on<img src="assets/img/nL.jpg" alt="nL"></p>
                <img src="assets/img/AddnL.jpg" alt="">
                <p>After each click on that, you will see the tiny number on the similar icon on the left side of that be increased.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/CounternL.jpg" alt="">
                <p>And for decreasing that just click on the (-) beside of the number.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/RemovenL.jpg" alt="">
                <p>All the items have this option and all of them will go to the new line by default (which means that the tiny number for all of them will show '1' by default).</p>
                <p class="tip"><b>Tip:</b> If you completely decrease that to zero (and it be disappeared), on the channel posts will be put just a space (' ') after that item, not any break line.</p>
                <p>The next option is changing the style of items. here be explained each items one by one:</p>
                <p>For accessing the other options of the items, after moving your mouse on them, click on that item and then the options will be slide down. <i>(Click on the area is indicated in the image below)</i></p>
                <img src="assets/img/ClickOnItems.jpg" alt="">
                <ol>
                  <li><mark class="blue">Title</mark>: You can change the style of the Title of the posts to Bold and Italic, and even make it as a Hyperlink that refers to the website post. Or maybe you want to leave it as Regular.</li>
                  <img src="assets/img/Title.jpg" alt="">
                  <li><mark class="blue">Excerpt</mark>: For the Excerpt you have the same options as the Title item.</li>
                  <img src="assets/img/Excerpt.jpg" alt="">
                  <li><mark class="blue">Content</mark>: For the Content you have the Bold and Italic Styles, and also you have another option to determine the max length of the content to be shown on the channel posts. <i>(The default value is 400 characters of the content)</i></li>
                  <img src="assets/img/Content.jpg" alt="">
                  <p class="tip"><b>Tip:</b> Telegram posts have a limitation of characters which be described in the next section (Featured Image).</p>
                  <li><mark class="blue">Tags</mark>: You are able to put the tags of the website posts in the channel posts as #Hashtag or even make them as Hyperlink that refer to their own link on the website. <i>(By default they are put as Hashtag)</i></li>
                  <img src="assets/img/Tags.jpg" alt="">
                  <li><mark class="blue">Read More</mark>: For this item you can just change the label of the hyperlink that refers to the website post. <i>(By default the label of that is 'Read More')</i></li>
                  <img src="assets/img/More.jpg" alt="">
                  <li><mark class="green">Custom Text</mark>: You can put your custom text here that be shown on the channel posts and you can make it Bold and Italic.</li>
                  <img src="assets/img/Custom.jpg" alt="">
                  <p>But if you select the Link option for this item, it will not refer to the website post. After you click on the Link option, another text-box will be appeared which you can enter your custom link there.</p>
                  <img src="assets/img/CustomLink.jpg" alt="">
                  <p class="tip"><b>Tip:</b> If you only enter a text in this item, it will be shown on the channel as a plain text. <br>If you only enter a link without any text, the link will be shown on the channel itself. <br>But if you enter a text along with a link, it will be shown as a hyperlink.</p>
                  <p class="important"><b>Important:</b> Ensure to put a valid link (means http[s]://...), because Telegram refuses to send an invalid link and the posts might be Not sent.</p>

                <p>You have another item that can be added to send Featured Image of the website posts.</p>
                <p>In order to add this item just click on any add button in the white box (it doesn't matter which one of them), and then click on <mark class="red">Featured Image</mark></p>
                <img src="assets/img/AddImage.jpg" alt="">
                <p>After that a pop-up message comes on and you must choose that you desire the image be shown Below the post text or Above the post text.</p>

                <p class="important"><b>Important:</b> The difference between them except its appearance, is because of the limitation of the characters that Telegram has for posts. So if the image be shown <u>Above</u> the text, you are able to send just <u>200</u> characters as the caption of the image.

                <p>After you choose the position of image, the item of that will be added.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/Image.jpg" alt="">
                <p>But you should know that, after you add the Feature Image item, you can change its position just by moving your mouse on the item and click on <i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-up"></i> or <i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-down"></i></p>

                <img src="assets/img/Sample.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="important"><b>Important:</b> Keep in mind, if the total characters of the post elements that are supposed to be sent to the channel be <u>more than</u> the limitation (200 characters for showing the image Above the text, and 4096 characters for showing the image Below the text), the post will Not be sent.</p>

              <h3>Link Buttons</h3>
              <div class="subContent">
                <p>After Adding the main elements of the posts, you might need to add some buttons at the bottom your posts that be referred to your custom link or the website post.</p>
                <p>For doing that just hover your cursor over the bigger box, and you will see another add button will be appeared under the white box.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/AddButton.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Just click on that to add a button.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/AddedButton.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Now you can see a button be added. For adding more buttons you have three options:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Add another button in a new row before this row of button</li>
                  <li>Add another button in a new row After this row of button</li>
                  <li>Add another button in the same row and just beside of that button</li>
                </ol>
                <p>For adding another button, hover your cursor over the added button and options for adding will be apeared.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/AddAnotherButton.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Click on the upper add button to add a new row of button before this row.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/AddAnotherButtonBefore.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Click on the lower add button to add a new row of button after this row.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/AddAnotherButtonAfter.jpg" alt="">
                <p>And Click on the little add button on the right side of the previous button to add a new button in the same row.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/AddAnotherButtonSame.jpg" alt="">
                <p>In this way you can add buttons with any order that you want. (For example like image below)</p>
                <img src="assets/img/AddAnotherButtons.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="tip"><b>Tip:</b> There is a limitation for adding button in a row, and you are able to add only 8 buttons in each row. But there is no limitation for adding rows.</p>
                <p>In order to remove a row of button, as you might guess, just click on <i class="fas fa-trash-alt"></i></p>
                <img src="assets/img/RemoveButton.jpg" alt="">
                <p>As you can see, the default caption for added buttons is 'Link'. In order to change their caption and also their link, click on each button and its options will be appeared.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/ButtonOptions.jpg" alt="">
                <p>By default it asks you to enter you custom link, but by selecting the <mark class="blue">Post Link</mark> you can set that button be referred to the website post.</p>
                <p>But if you select <mark class="blue">Custom Link</mark>, you <u>must</u> put your link in its field.</p>
                <p class="important"><b>Important:</b> If you select Custom Link, Ensure to Not leave the link field empty and put a valid link (means http[s]://...), because Telegram refuses to send an invalid link and the posts might be Not sent.</p>

                <p>Maybe you would like to set a Delay for sending posts to the channel after they be published on the website, for any reason.</p>
                <p>For setting a Delay, click on <i class="fas fa-stopwatch"></i> at the top-right  corner of the white box.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/Delay.jpg" alt="">
                <p>After clicking on that you can enter the delay in minute. <i>(Enter 0 or leave it empty to unset the delay)</i></p>
                <img src="assets/img/SetDelay.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="important"><b>Important:</b> Remember that if you set a delay, for instance 10 minutes, and your post be published at 12 o'clock on the website. So as you expect, that post be sent to the channel at 12:10 (which means this time will be scheduled to send the post). BUT WordPress will send that just when someone visits your webiste and the schedule time has passed.<br>Therefore, this option <u>doesn't be recommended</u>. just use it if you have to, or your website has many visitors.</p>

            <p>As you can remember, there is a option in the Customize tab for telling the plugin to send the website posts to the channel (titled <mark class="blue">Enable Auto-Posting</mark>), that is only a default setting (which means, the plugin will send all the website posts to the channel by default).</p>
            <p>Additionally that option, there is another option in the editor page for sending/editing the posts, which titled 'Telegram Post Options'. Via that box you can tell the plugin whether to send this individual post to the channel.</p>
            <img src="assets/img/TelegramPostOptions.jpg" alt="">
            <p>If you be on editing a post, and that post has already been sent to the channel, the first option in that box will be titled <mark class="blue">Update This Post</mark>, and <u>if you edited the website post, that post in the channel will be edited</u> as well.</p>

            <p class="tip"><b>Tip:</b> The Default value of the first option in that box (<u>Send This Post/Update This Post</u>) depends on the value of <u>Enable Auto-Posting</u> in the Customize tab in Telegram Settings menu.</p>
            <p class="tip"><b>Tip:</b> If you want to update the post in the channel and that post has already been <u>deleted</u> from the channel, the post will be sent <u>again, as a new post</u>.</p>
            <p class="tip"><b>Tip:</b> If you want to update the post in the channel in order to <u>change the position of the image</u>, that post in the channel will not be changed and this post will be sent to the channel <u>as a new post</u>.</p>
            <p>The second option in that box which titled <mark class="green">Pin This Post</mark> is used to pin this post in the channel after it be sent to the channel or be updated there. By pinning a post, it will be shown at the top of the channel.</p>
            <img src="assets/img/PinPost.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The next option is in the <mark class="blue">Posts &rarr; All Posts</mark> that shows all of your published posts.</p>
            <p>As you can see, a new column has been added here, which has Telegram icon <i class="telegramColumn fab fa-telegram fa-lg" style="color: rgba(0, 136, 204, .7);"></i></p>
            <img src="assets/img/TelegramColumn.jpg" alt="">

            <p>By clicking on each icon, its post will be sent to the channel. <i>(This option is just a quick way to send the posts to the channel)</i></p>
            <p>After clicking on them, a short loading will be displayed (like this <i class="fas fa-spinner fa-spin" style="color: rgba(0, 136, 204, .7);"></i>), and after just few seconds that post will be sent to the channel.</p>
            <p>If the post be sent to the channel, that icon will be changed and shows the number zero, for now.</p>
            <img src="assets/img/LinkClick.jpg" alt="">
            <p>This is an exciting number that shows the number of visitors who have opened the link of that post through the channel and have visited the post on the website. which means this number will be increased by any visitor that comes to your website post via your channel. <i>(LC is abbreviation for Link Click)</i></p>
